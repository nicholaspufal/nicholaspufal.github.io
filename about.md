Hey there! My name is Nicholas Pufal and I'm a Staff Software Engineer currently working @
[Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/about/company).

I'm a seasoned Ruby developer, proficient in Javascript, who loves to build software with quality in mind.

I have a strong background in agile methodologies, distributed systems and I'm always keen on being part of pragmatic teams that lean on automated processes.
