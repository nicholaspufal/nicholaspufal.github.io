Hey there! My name is Nicholas Pufal and I'm a full-stack / backend developer who really enjoys to work with Javascript, Ruby and automation/build tools.

I love to build cool things and to build them with quality in mind.

I'm very passionate about good development practices and ways to improve an agile team communication/delivered quality - a broad subject which includes ideas such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Specification by Example.
